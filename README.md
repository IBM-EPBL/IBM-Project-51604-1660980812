# INTRODUCTION

  Inventory software, also known as an inventory management system, is a solution that allows businesses 
to track, organize, and oversee all of their inventory, as well as their inventory-related processes. 
Retail inventory management isthe process of ensuring you carry merchandise that shoppers want, with neither
too little nor too much on hand. By managing inventory, retailers meet customer demand without running 
out of stock or carrying excess supply.

   In practice, effective retail inventory management results in lower costs and a better understanding
of sales patterns. Retail inventory management tools and methods give retailers more information on which 
to run their businesses. Applications have been developed to help retailers track and manage stocks related to
their own products.The System will ask retailers to create their accounts by providing essential details. 
Retailers can access their accounts by logging into the application.

  Once retailers successfully log in to the application they can update their inventory details, also users
will be able to add new stock by submitting essential details related to the stock. They can view details of the 
current inventory. The System will automatically send an email alert to the retailers if there is no stock found
in their accounts. So that they can order new stock.

  Inventory software can save you from unnecessary costs. There are a number of common inventory expenses 
that can easily be avoided, like overstocking which requires additional storage space, human error, and late or 
incorrect order fulfilment which leads to returns. Using inventory software can answer each of these problems 
and more.Inventory forecasting can solve the problem of overstocking by telling you just how much stock you are 
going to need to meet your demand. Using automation to help with error-prone tasks like stock taking and generating
reports can reduce or even completely eliminate human error.Having an accurate real-time record of your stock can help
you figure out which orders you can fulfill on time and correctly, reducing the chances of returns.
